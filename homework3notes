The result (the count) should be the same. The point of the homework is to compare bytes processed in the BigQuery job info:
Non-partitioned: scans (almost) the whole table → many GB.
Partitioned + clustered: scans only Q1 partitions and only blocks for those three bases → much fewer MB.
So the file is showing you: same logic, same answer, but partitioning + clustering reduce how much data BigQuery has to read, 


- Partition = divides data by time
- Clustering = sorts data inside each partition
- Grouping = aggregates data in a query

Partition → contains many blocks
   ↓
Clustering → sorts blocks by vendorid, passenger_count
   ↓
Query → BigQuery reads block metadata
   ↓
Prunes blocks that don’t match
   ↓
Scans only the relevant blocks
